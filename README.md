### Task: Land Cover Classification
You are a data scientist working with an environmental conservation organisation focused on promoting sustainable land management practices. The organisation has collected a comprehensive dataset containing geospatial data for a region experiencing rapid land-use changes. The dataset includes three key land cover categories:
* Buildings
* Cropland
* Woody vegetation cover (>60%)

The organisation aims to use this data to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify land cover into these three categories. The model should output occurrence probabilities for each class.
#### Objective:
Your task is to build a robust predictive model that can classify land cover into the three target categories .
#### Deliverables
* Complete GitHub repository containing:
Source code/notebooks with the entire process
* Technical report (1-2 pages) including:
    * Detailed methodology and approach
    * Critical findings and recommendations
* Provide a test set submission in the specified format , with predicted labels and corresponding occurrence probabilities for each class.
